\section{Objective}
%
Placement in an academic position that allows for advanced research in pervasive computing (i.e., modeling, analysis, design, and verification) with a particular focus on simulation.

\section{Citizenship}

\section{Research Themes}
%
My current research is focussed on the engineering aspects of pervasive computing, with the goal of providing a robust, easy, and coherent chain of tools and procedures that can lead to robust, adaptive, self-healing, and possibly evolving software ecosystems. I recently got fascinated by aggregate programming, namely all the languages and techniques that enable the programming of groups of devices as a single entity distributed in space and time.

Self-organising pervasive ecosystems of devices are set to become a major vehicle for delivering infrastructure and end-user services. The inherent complexity of such systems poses new challenges to those who want to dominate it by applying the principles of engineering. The recent growth in number and distribution of devices with decent computational and communicational abilities, that suddenly accelerated with the massive diffusion of smartphones and tablets, is delivering a world with a much higher density of devices in space. Also, communication technologies seem to be focussing on short-range device-to-device (P2P) interactions, with technologies such as Bluetooth and Near-Field Communication gaining greater adoption. Locality and situatedness become key to providing the best possible experience to users, and the classic model of a centralised, enormously powerful server gathering and processing data becomes less and less efficient with device density. Accomplishing complex global tasks without a centralised controller responsible of aggregating data, however, is a challenging task. In particular, there is a local-to-global issue that makes the application of engineering principles challenging at least: designing device-local programs that, through interaction, guarantee a certain global service level. In this thesis, we first analyse the state of the art in coordination systems, then motivate the work by describing the main issues of pre-existing tools and practices and identifying the improvements that would benefit the design of such complex software ecosystems.
The contribution can be divided in three main branches. First, we introduce a novel simulation toolchain for pervasive ecosystems, designed for allowing good expressiveness still retaining high performance. Second, we leverage existing coordination models and patterns in order to create new spatial structures. Third, we introduce a novel language, based on the existing ``Field Calculus'' and integrated with the aforementioned toolchain, designed to be usable for practical aggregate programming.

 My master thesis was focused in the definition of a model and the realisation of a framework to simulate pervasive service ecosystems as they are meant in the \sapere\ European Project. It analyses the relevance of the simulation both in the scientific method and in the specific context of pervasive computing. It introduces the Monte Carlo method and its realisation in the biochemistry field, through the well-known Stochastic Simulation Algorithms (SSA) described first by Gillespie and then optimized by Gibson and Slepoy. A computational model able to face highly dynamic requirements is then introduced, and an extension to the existing SSA algorithm ``Next Reaction'' is proposed to support it. The simulation framework Alchemist was then developed, and two case studies featuring high complexity (morphogenesis and crowd steering) were shown.

 My bachelor thesis discusses the motivations which are pressing software engineers to move away from the object oriented towards the multi agent programming paradigm. It introduces the concept of coordination among agents with specific focus on the Linda tuple spaces medium and its extension with programmable behaviour, \texttt{TuCSoN}. Nature-inspired patterns are discussed and a taxonomy is proposed. A proof-of-concept example is then proposed, exploiting \texttt{TuCSoN} to produce a real distributed application which uses an ant-inspired pattern.

\begin{innerlist}
    \item Javadoc.io linker is a Gradle plugin that configures any Javadoc build to link javadoc.io when referring to non-local classes.
\end{innerlist}
\halfblankline

Designer and developer of \href{https://github.com/DanySK/SmarTrRR}{SmarTrRR}, 2015--today
\begin{innerlist}
    \item SmarTrRR is a transitive dependency range resolver plugin for Gradle. It replaces the default Protelis resolver, implementing a progressive range restriction, and a conflict resolution algorithm. Also, it allows the user to configure specific artifact substitutions.
\end{innerlist}
\halfblankline

Designer and leading developer of \href{http://protelis.org/}{Protelis}, 2014--today
\begin{innerlist}
    \item Protelis is a programming language aiming at making networked systems just as easy to build for complex and heterogeneous networks as for single machines and cloud systems. This accomplished by separating the different tasks and making some of the hard and subtle parts automatic and implicit.
\end{innerlist}
\halfblankline

Designer and leading developer of \href{http://alchemist.apice.unibo.it/}{Alchemist}, 2010--today
\begin{innerlist}
    \item Alchemist is an innovative simulator meant to join the expressiveness of the agent based modelling and the power and speed of the stochastic simulation algorithms used in chemistry. It is tailored to scenarios in which many nodes interact exchanging  informations. Its flexibility allows for a wide range of applications, spacing from the classical chemistry to the biology (e.g. complex morphogenesis processes) to pervasive computing.

Creator and maintainer of \href{https://bitbucket.org/danysk/nirvana-overlay/}{Nirvana overlay} for Gentoo Linux, 2014--2015
\begin{innerlist}
    \item Nirvana is an overlay for Gentoo Linux, namely a container of ebuild files, which are scripts describing how to install and maintain packages in a Gentoo Linux distribution. Nirvana contains those ebuild that work well, but are too hard to maintain to be pushed in Sunrise or Sabayon overlays. Moreover, this repository is used by me as a playground for creating new ebuilds. On July 2014 Nirvana got officially indexed by Layman, and as a consequence it is now available to all Gentoo users using such tool.
\end{innerlist}
\halfblankline

Creator and maintainer of {Nirvana Community Repository}, 2014--2015
\begin{innerlist}
    \item Nirvana Community Repository contains the same packages included in Nirvana overlay, distributed in a pre-compiled form compatible with Sabayon Linux Entropy package manager.
\end{innerlist}

\begin{innerlist}
  \item Member of both testing team and developers team. Sabayon Linux is a Gentoo-based distribution which follows the works-out-of-the-box philosophy, aiming to give the user a wide number of applications that are ready for use and a self-configured operating system.
\end{innerlist}
\halfblankline

\href{http://www.astice.org/}{A.St.I.Ce. Executive Board Member}, January 2006 to November 2009
    \begin{innerlist}
      \item Founded ``I$^2$ --- Informa Ingegneri'', the technical journal of Seconda Facoltà di Ingegneria, containing articles about the research activity of the faculty.
      \item Founded ``Linux Libera Tutti'', a project meant to allow students access without any charge DVDs and CDs of various Linux distributions, with a special focus on Sabayon Linux.
