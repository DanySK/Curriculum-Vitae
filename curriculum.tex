\section{Objective}
%
Placement in an academic position that allows for advanced research in pervasive computing (i.e., modeling, analysis, design, and verification) with a particular focus on simulation.

\section{Citizenship}
Italy

\section{Research Themes}
%
My current research is focussed on the engineering aspects of pervasive computing, with the goal of providing a robust, easy, and coherent chain of tools and procedures that can lead to robust, adaptive, self-healing, and possibly evolving software ecosystems. I recently got fascinated by aggregate programming, namely all the languages and techniques that enable the programming of groups of devices as a single entity distributed in space and time.

Self-organising pervasive ecosystems of devices are set to become a major vehicle for delivering infrastructure and end-user services. The inherent complexity of such systems poses new challenges to those who want to dominate it by applying the principles of engineering. The recent growth in number and distribution of devices with decent computational and communicational abilities, that suddenly accelerated with the massive diffusion of smartphones and tablets, is delivering a world with a much higher density of devices in space. Also, communication technologies seem to be focussing on short-range device-to-device (P2P) interactions, with technologies such as Bluetooth and Near-Field Communication gaining greater adoption. Locality and situatedness become key to providing the best possible experience to users, and the classic model of a centralised, enormously powerful server gathering and processing data becomes less and less efficient with device density. Accomplishing complex global tasks without a centralised controller responsible of aggregating data, however, is a challenging task. In particular, there is a local-to-global issue that makes the application of engineering principles challenging at least: designing device-local programs that, through interaction, guarantee a certain global service level. In this thesis, we first analyse the state of the art in coordination systems, then motivate the work by describing the main issues of pre-existing tools and practices and identifying the improvements that would benefit the design of such complex software ecosystems.
The contribution can be divided in three main branches. First, we introduce a novel simulation toolchain for pervasive ecosystems, designed for allowing good expressiveness still retaining high performance. Second, we leverage existing coordination models and patterns in order to create new spatial structures. Third, we introduce a novel language, based on the existing ``Field Calculus'' and integrated with the aforementioned toolchain, designed to be usable for practical aggregate programming.

 My master thesis was focused in the definition of a model and the realisation of a framework to simulate pervasive service ecosystems as they are meant in the \sapere\ European Project. It analyses the relevance of the simulation both in the scientific method and in the specific context of pervasive computing. It introduces the Monte Carlo method and its realisation in the biochemistry field, through the well-known Stochastic Simulation Algorithms (SSA) described first by Gillespie and then optimized by Gibson and Slepoy. A computational model able to face highly dynamic requirements is then introduced, and an extension to the existing SSA algorithm ``Next Reaction'' is proposed to support it. The simulation framework Alchemist was then developed, and two case studies featuring high complexity (morphogenesis and crowd steering) were shown.

 My bachelor thesis discusses the motivations which are pressing software engineers to move away from the object oriented towards the multi agent programming paradigm. It introduces the concept of coordination among agents with specific focus on the Linda tuple spaces medium and its extension with programmable behaviour, \texttt{TuCSoN}. Nature-inspired patterns are discussed and a taxonomy is proposed. A proof-of-concept example is then proposed, exploiting \texttt{TuCSoN} to produce a real distributed application which uses an ant-inspired pattern.
